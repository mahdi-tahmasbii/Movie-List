## Introduction

The Movie List App is a web application built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, React Query, and Material Tailwind. It allows users to browse a collection of movies, search for specific titles, and view detailed information about each film. The app leverages modern web technologies to provide a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering, routing, and other powerful features out of the box.
- **React**: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for creating interactive UIs.
- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality, readability, and maintainability.
- **React Query**: React Query is a powerful data-fetching library for React applications, providing tools for managing and caching asynchronous data.
- **Material Tailwind**: Material Tailwind is a UI component library based on Tailwind CSS, offering pre-designed components for building responsive and visually appealing interfaces.
- **Axios**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making network requests, used here for fetching movie data from external APIs.
- **ESLint**: ESLint is a pluggable linting utility for JavaScript and TypeScript, helping to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Prettier**: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that ensures consistent code style across the project.
- **Husky**: Husky is a tool for running scripts before git commits, enabling automated code checks and tests.
